# Overview
Kotracker. A simple console app to track and manage daily expenses.

This project was built as a one-week Kotlin sprint to practice basic programming concepts and object-oriented design. The goal was to create a small but complete app from scratch.

The app runs in the terminal and lets users add, view, edit, and delete expenses. Each expense stores a date, name, category, and amount. It also shows basic statistics such as total spending and expenses grouped by category.

This project focuses on learning Kotlin fundamentals like classes, data classes, collections, loops, conditionals, and simple modular structure.
